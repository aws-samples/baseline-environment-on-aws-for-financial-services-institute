# Finance reference architecture for Japan

[In Japanese](README.md)

Finance reference architecture for Japan consists of three contents.

- [Well-Architected Framework FSI Lens for FISC](#well-architected-framework-fsi-lens-for-fisc)
- [Best practices for financial workloads](#best-practices-for-financial-workloads)
- [Baseline Environment on AWS for Financial Services Institute](#Baseline Environment on AWS for Financial Services Institute)

# Well-Architected Framework FSI Lens for FISC

By extending AWS Well-Architected review, best practices on specific technology areas or each industry are provided as AWS Well-Architected Lens. "Well-Architected Framework FSI Lens for FISC" in Finance reference architecture for Japan is a Lens which focuses on how to design and deploy financial workload in order to enhance resiliency, security and maintenance aligned with FISC Security Guidelines on Computer Systems.

# Best practices for financial workloads

Best practices for financial workloads is an asset provided as a part of "Finance reference architecture for Japan". Securing availability and resilience on financial systems deeply depends on the characteristic of workload itself. From the point of this view, We provide sample applications bellow including cdk IaC code as popular workloads in financial industry.

# Baseline Environment on AWS for Financial Services Institute

Baseline Environment on AWS for Financial Services Institute (BLEA for FSI) is an asset provided as part of the Financial Reference Architecture Japan Edition. It provides CDK templates, configuration guides, and FISC-compliant mappings for building secure baselines and helps infrastructure automation(IaC) of the systems that meet FISC security standards on AWS." It consists of "BLEA for FSI Governance Base" and "Sample Applications for Financial Workload Best Practices.

Based on [BLEA](https://github.com/aws-samples/baseline-environment-on-aws/), a set of reference CDK templates for establishing secure baselines, this asset provides a set of confidentiality, integrity, and availability elements required for financial workloads in terms of a FISC-compliant perspective. We also provide the following end-to-end CDK sample code for typical financial workloads. These CDK templates are intended to be extended by the user to suit their own requirement.

- Banking
- Open API
- Customer Channels
- Market Data

## Introducing BLEA for FSI

This section describes the procedure for deploying 'BLEA for FSI' in an AWS account environment, assuming that 'BLEA for FSI' is deployed in an account under ControlTower management. If you only deploy to your AWS account, you do not necessarily need to build an editor environment using Visual Studio Code for just deployment, but only the CDK runtime is required.

### Prerequisites

Please refer to the following for the client prerequisites for deploying 'BLEA for FSI' on AWS.

- [Prerequisites for BLEA for FSI deployment](doc/pre-conditions.md)

If you cannot directly connect to the Internet from the client environment, please refer to the following procedure for setting up a CDK execution environment on a closed private network.

- [Procedure]: [Setup Procedure for CDK Deployment on a Closed Network](./doc/cdk-deployment-environment-setup.md)

### Deployment Flow

'BLEA for FSI' is configured for a multi-account environment with AWS Control Tower, so it is necessary to configure and deploy Control Tower first, followed by additional configuration and deployment of 'BLEA for FSI'. The most typical procedure is described here.

If you cannot directly connect to the Internet from the client environment, please refer to the following procedure for setting up a CDK execution environment on a closed private network.

- [Procedure]: [Setup Procedure for CDK Deployment in a Closed Network](./doc/cdk-deployment-environment-setup.md)

> NOTE: `MC` denotes working in the management console, `Local` denotes working in the deployment client environment.

1. 'BLEA for FSI' Governance Base deployment

   1.1. setup AWS Control Tower and security services (MC)

   1.2. create a guest account in AWS Control Tower for deployment (MC)

   1.3. install dependent packages and build code (Local)

   1.4. configure AWS CLI credentials for AWS IAM Identity Center (Local)

   1.5. configure additional settings in the Control Tower Admin/Log Archive account (MC)

   1.6. Deploy Governance Base for guest accounts (Local)

2. Deploy the Financial Workload Sample Application

   2.1. Deploy the CDK template for the sample application to the guest account (Local)

   2.2. Do additional configuration on the guest account (MC)
